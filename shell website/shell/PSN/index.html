                <p>It certainly wasn’t the miracle on ice of 1980, but TJ Oshie turned in an overtime performance that will be legendary in its own right.  Oshie single handedly beat team Russia in a thrilling shootout victory for the United States on Saturday, scoring an amazing four shoot out goals.  The win was their second of what would end up being three wins by the conclusion of round robin play.  Going into these winter games, the U.S. didn’t really figure to be much of a contender for Gold.   Most of the attention seemed to focus on the obvious choices, Team Canada, Czech Republic, and of course the host Russia.  There is no doubt now, especially after this opening weekend, that the United States are for real in this tournament.  The puck control, defense, and power play have been nothing short of brilliant.  U.S.A and Penguins coach Dan Bylsma seems to be pushing all the right buttons and more importantly, the team is buying in.  U.S.A. Hockey keeps making a name for itself, and this year just maybe, the U.S. will capture the gold medal again. </p>

                <p>If you haven’t heard by now, the Philadelphia Phillies have signed former Pirates’ pitcher AJ Burnett to a one year sixteen million dollar contract to pitch in 2014.  There are certain reports circulating that the Pirates did step in and offered somewhere between 11-13 million as a counter offer.  This, my friends is inexcusable.  AJ Burnett, even with the subpar playoff start, was your staff ace.  He was a good locker room guy with a competitive mean streak.  I would even go as far as to say that he was one of the top reasons your buccos broke a twenty one year losing streak.  Having said that, they couldn’t even pony up a bit more to match Philly?  Really?  What even makes matters worse, they had a chance late last fall to sign him to a tender offer for 14 million dollars.  How was that not a no brainer?  If he retires you lose nothing.  If he signs somewhere else, you gain a first round draft pick.  And for a team like the Pirates who covets draft picks the way they do, again, really?  We have been told time and time again by the organizations top brass that they would be willing to pay for top talent.  Well, I didn’t see that here.  Just another broken promise, in a long line of broken promises.  Between receiving upwards for 40 million dollars from international television revenue and all of the revenue from hosting post season baseball, where did the money go?  Why are we making more money and then decreasing payroll?  Maybe instead of signing AJ Burnett, Bob Nutting decided he would rather buy another ski resort in the Laurel Mountains.  </p>

                <p>As we are rapidly approaching spring, the NFL draft is right around the corner.  And judging by the Steelers up and down, 8-8, 2013 season, we can all agree that there are some holes that need filled.  From everything that I have read in local media, the biggest need seems to be on defense.  While I don’t dispute that, I don’t think that it should be the top priority going into the first round unless a complete no brainer falls into your lap.  The Steelers are drafting in the middle of the first round at 15.  That is a perfect position in this year’s draft to get a difference maker that can help us win now.  While I agree that our defense is getting old and our secondary could use the help, I still think they are a passable unit, especially in the age of modern football where teams just try to outscore their opponents by passing offense.  That leads me to the idea of forgetting the defense, go offense and give Big Ben more tools to outscore the other team.  It is not out of the realm that someone like Texas A&M’s Mike Evans or USC’s Marques Lee will be available at our pick.  Having somebody with their size and athletic ability opposite Antonio Brown, it would stretch the field and open up an offense that was already progressing at the end of last season.  Everyone would benefit, even the running game with those able body receivers going down the field.  That would equal more points, and in the end maybe make this mini rebuilding process we are going through a little bit quicker.  </p>

                <h2>Not good times for Pitt Hoops</h2>

                <p>After watching USA hockey upset Russia on Saturday morning, I was riding high going into the afternoon to watch our beloved Pitt hoops squad go into the “Dean” dome and take on the North Carolina Tarheels.  Well that “high” was short lived as the Panthers lost another game in excruciating fashion for the second game in a row.  The Panthers hung around and even came back from a twelve point deficit to make the final few minutes interesting.  Even with all of that, they were simply out gunned.  The Tarheels and the Syracuse Orangemen proved one thing this past week in two Panther losses, we don’t have the length, shooting ability, and overall talent to hang with the big boys in college basketball.  Lamar Patterson, our best player, has been very inconsistent lately.  To his credit, he has been hampered by a sore thumb though.  Talib Zana, our other senior leader, has no excuse.  He has simply looked lost when facing elite teams.  Not only that, our head coach Jamie Dixon, has shown his reluctance to make in game strategy changes.  His insistence on playing predominately man to man defense against opponents that have superior talent, has proven to be crippling.  As much as it pains me to say it heading into March Madness, Pitt doesn’t look sweet enough to get to the field of 16, and certainly not elite enough to get to the final eight.  </p>

                <p>The Penguins are off to a great start for the 2013-2014 campaign.  They have been simply dominant.  Leading the league in offense, wins, and points.  They seem to be a shoe in yet again for the first overall seed in the playoffs come this spring.  The only problem is with this is, I have seen this movie before.  Many times.  Since 2009, when the Pens won the Stanley Cup, to say it has been a little rough would be too nice.  For the past two seasons the Penguins have been by far the league’s best regular season team just to fall short when games mean the most.  What is even more of a shame is they also have the NHL’s two best players (Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin) that 2009 should have been the first of many Cups for Pittsburgh.  Instead, it has ended in season after season of playoff disappointment.  Like I said, I have seen this movie before.  </p>
